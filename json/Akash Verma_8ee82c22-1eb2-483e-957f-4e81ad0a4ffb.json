  },
  "strengths": [
    "Strong grasp of fundamental programming logic and web development concepts, as evidenced by correct answers to technical MCQs.",
    "Good analytical skills for pattern recognition and problem diagnosis in defined contexts (e.g., number sequence, performance diagnosis).",
    "Ability to correctly identify optimal solutions for common technical challenges and sequential dependencies.",
    "Effective at selecting appropriate communication strategies for specific, straightforward scenarios."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Lack of demonstrated creativity or innovative thinking, as no responses were provided for questions requiring original ideas.",
    "Limited evidence of in-depth problem-solving for complex, multi-faceted scenarios, as subjective problem-solving questions were not attempted.",
    "Inability to articulate detailed troubleshooting processes, comprehensive solutions, or strategic thinking for open-ended problems.",
    "Absence of demonstrated ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly and concisely to non-technical stakeholders, as relevant subjective questions were not answered.",
    "Did not attempt subjective questions, which significantly hinders a full assessment of higher-order cognitive and communication skills."
  ],
  "summary": "Akash demonstrates a solid foundation in core technical concepts and logical reasoning, performing well on objective, multiple-choice questions related to web development and general aptitude. He can identify correct solutions and apply established patterns. However, his performance on subjective questions was absent, which severely limits the evaluation of his creativity, ability to articulate complex problem-solving strategies, and nuanced communication skills. While proficient in foundational areas, there's no evidence of deeper analytical thinking, innovative solution design, or comprehensive communication required for more open-ended challenges."
