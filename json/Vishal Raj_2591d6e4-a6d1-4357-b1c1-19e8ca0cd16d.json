  "summary": "Vishal demonstrates a commendable aptitude for logical and analytical reasoning when presented with structured, well-defined problems, as evidenced by his perfect performance on quantitative, pattern-based, and deductive reasoning multiple-choice questions. He exhibits strong problem-solving skills within these specific contexts. However, his performance drastically declines in tasks requiring open-ended thought, creativity, and detailed communication. His responses to subjective questions were either non-answers, irrelevant, or self-congratulatory, indicating a significant weakness in articulating ideas, formulating arguments, or engaging in creative problem-solving. This suggests a cognitive profile that excels in applying established rules and patterns but struggles with independent ideation, expressive communication, and nuanced conceptual explanation."
