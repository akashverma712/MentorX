  "strengths": [
    "Aptitude for recognizing efficient algorithmic approaches and data structures (e.g., bitwise operations, scheduling strategies).",
    "Strong pattern recognition skills, particularly for numerical sequences.",
    "Ability to identify logical flaws in arguments and understand basic critical thinking concepts (e.g., correlation vs. causation).",
    "Good at solving specific types of logical puzzles that require inverse thinking."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Significant difficulty with open-ended questions requiring creative thought, original ideas, or detailed explanations.",
    "Complete failure to engage with questions that demand written responses or generation of solutions.",
    "Lack of attention to detail or unwillingness to perform basic numerical calculations.",
    "Extremely poor communication skills, as evidenced by the absence of meaningful responses to subjective prompts.",
    "Struggles with practical application and execution of problem-solving beyond selecting pre-defined options."
  ],
  "summary": "Vishal demonstrates a foundational understanding of logical reasoning and algorithmic concepts, performing adequately on multiple-choice questions that test recognition of correct answers or patterns. This aligns with his stated interest in LeetCode, suggesting an ability to identify and apply known solutions. However, his performance on subjective and calculation-based questions is extremely poor, characterized by a complete lack of engagement and irrelevant responses. This indicates significant weaknesses in practical problem-solving, creativity, attention to detail, and communication skills. While he can identify correct approaches, he struggles to articulate, apply, or generate solutions independently, particularly in non-structured or open-ended scenarios."
