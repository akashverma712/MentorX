    "Complete absence of creative thinking and imaginative responses.",
    "Severe inability to articulate thoughts, explain concepts clearly, or engage meaningfully with open-ended questions, often resorting to non-answers or irrelevant statements."

  "summary": "Vishal demonstrates a foundational grasp of basic quantitative problem-solving, as evidenced by his correct answers on percentage calculations, average speed, and the water jug problem. However, his aptitude performance is significantly inconsistent and concerning in several key areas. He struggles with abstract pattern recognition, understanding recursive programming concepts despite his stated interest in Python, and exhibits profound weaknesses in logical deduction and critical reasoning. Most notably, his responses to subjective questions ('what the heck', 'what', and a nonsensical answer for creativity) reveal a severe lack of engagement, creative thinking, and coherent communication. This indicates an uneven cognitive profile, where basic computational skills are present but higher-order analytical, creative, and communicative abilities are largely undeveloped or unexpressed in this assessment context."
